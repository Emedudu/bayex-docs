# Secure Relayer Setup

Bayex uses a relayer system to subsidize gas for user onboarding or specific interactions. Security is paramount when handling the relayer's private keys.

## The Problem
Storing private keys on the client-side (e.g., in `.env` exposed to the browser) is a critical security vulnerability.

## The Solution: External Relayer Service

We utilize the **Polymarket Relayer** (`relayer-v2`) for executing gasless transactions. This removes the need for managing a hot wallet on your own backend for standard operations.

### Architecture

1.  **Client Signature**: The user signs a typed data structure (EIP-712) in their browser. This signature grants permission for the specific action (e.g., `CTWrapper.wrap`).
2.  **Relayer Submission**: The frontend sends this signature and the transaction payload to the Relayer API.
3.  **Execution**: The Relayer verifies the payload, pays the MATIC gas fees, and submits the transaction to the Polygon network.

### API Endpoint

**Production:** `https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/`

### Implementation Flow

Instead of sending transactions directly via `window.ethereum`:

1.  Construct the meta-transaction payload.
2.  Request user signature via `eth_signTypedData_v4`.
3.  POST the payload to the Relayer.

```typescript
// Example Payload Construction
const payload = {
  to: contractAddress,
  data: encodedFunctionData,
  signature: userSignature,
  // ... other relayer specific fields
};

await axios.post("https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/transactions", payload);
```
