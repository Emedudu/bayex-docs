## Core Mechanics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Conditional Token Wrapping" icon="layer-group">
    Polymarket uses the **ERC-1155** standard for outcome shares, which are incompatible with most DeFi AMMs.
    
    Bayex introduces a trustless **Wrapper Contract** that locks these ERC-1155 tokens and mints standard **ERC-20** tokens 1:1.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uniswap V4 Integration" icon="bolt">
    We leverage **Uniswap V4** to create concentrated liquidity pools for these wrapped outcome tokens.
    
    This allows LPs to provide liquidity in specific price ranges (probabilities), dramatically increasing capital efficiency compared to traditional AMMs.

## Yield Generation

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Trading Fees" icon="chart-simple">
    LPs earn swap fees every time a user trades against their position. With V4, fees are auto-compounded.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Underlying Yield" icon="coins">
    **(Coming Soon)** Collateral parked in Bayex contracts can be deployed to lending protocols like Aave.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Impermanent Loss*" icon="shield-check">
    *If you hold to expiry, the winning outcome redeems 1:1 for collateral, mitigating divergence loss.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Uniswap V4 (Swap/LP)">
    These ERC-20s are then used in **Uniswap V4** pools for swapping and liquidity provision, managed by Bayex Hooks.
