<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet" icon="wallet">
    Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top right.
    Bayex uses account abstraction to create a secure **Smart Account** (Safe) for you automatically. This system is **100% compatible** with Polymarket's proxy accounts.

    <Note>
      **Gasless Transactions**
      
      Because you use a Smart Account, the protocol sponsors your gas fees for trading and LPing. You only need USDC.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fund with USDC" icon="coins">
    Bayex operates on the **Polygon** network. You need to deposit **USDC** into your Smart Account to trade.

    *   Send **USDC (Polygon PoS)** to your Smart Account address displayed in the wallet menu.
    *   Or use the "Deposit" button to bridge funds from other networks.
  </Step>
